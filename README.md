# CryptoBoolFun
Java library for computing cryptographic properties of Boolean functions, such as:

* Hamming Weight
* Nonlinearity
* Correlation-Immunity
* Propagation Criteria
* Algebraic Degree
* Transform representations such as Walsh spectrum (via fast Walsh transform) and Algebraic Normal Form (ANF, via fast Moebius Transform)
